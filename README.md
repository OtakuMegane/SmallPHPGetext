# SmallPHPGettext

A small library written in PHP to handle gettext functions. Done as a combination learning experience and because a gettext library that uses .po files was needed for Nelliel. Minimal but functional.

Requires PHP 7.0+
Uses .po files for input. Support for .mo files might be added later.
